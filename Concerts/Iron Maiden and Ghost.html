       <h1>Ghost</h1>    
    <p><b>Ghost is a Swedish Heavy Metal Band formed in 2006. Ghost is easily recognizable owing greatly to its eccentric on-stage presence. Five of the group's six members, its 'Nameless Ghouls', wear virtually identical, face-concealing costumes. The most distinguishable member is its vocalist, called 'Papa Emeritus', who wears a prosthetic mask of skull face paint and appears as what can be described as a "demonic anti-Pope." Each album cycle has brought about a change in the band's appearance. Though the vocalist is always portrayed as roughly the same archetypal character, there are slight appearance changes, and even altered personality traits from former versions.</b></p>
