            <h1>Breaking Benjamin</h1> 
    <p><b>Breaking Benjamin is an American rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup of the band also included guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. Despite significant lineup changes, the band's musical style and lyrical content have remained consistent, with Burnley serving as the primary composer and lead vocalist since the band's inception. The band has commonly been noted for its formulaic hard rock tendencies with angst-heavy lyrics, swelling choruses, and "crunching" guitars. In the United States alone, the band has sold more than 7 million units and yielded three RIAA-certified platinum records, two gold records, and several certified singles, including one multi-platinum, three platinum, and four gold. The band has also produced one number one record on the Billboard 200. </b></p>

            <h1>Shinedown</h1> 
    <p><b>Shinedown is an American rock band from Jacksonville, Florida. Formed by Brent Smith in 2001 after the dissolution of his prior band, Smith, still under contract with record label Atlantic Records, recruited the band's original lineup of Jasin Todd as guitarist, Brad Stewart on bass, and Barry Kerch on drums. Consistent for the first two album cycles, a few lineup changes followed in the late 2000s, eventually stabilizing with Smith and Kerch, as remaining members alongside newcomers Zach Myers on guitar, and Eric Bass on bass. The group has released five albums: Leave a Whisper (2003), Us and Them (2005), The Sound of Madness (2008), Amaryllis (2012), and Threat to Survival (2015). Shinedown has sold more than ten million records worldwide, and has had 11 number one singles on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts, the third most of all-time, behind Van Halen and Three Days Grace. </b></p>
