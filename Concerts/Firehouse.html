            <h1>Firehouse</h1> 
    <p><b>FireHouse is an American glam metal band formed in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1989. The band reached stardom during the early 1990s with hit singles like "Reach For The Sky" and "All She Wrote", as well as their signature power ballads "I Live My Life for You", "Love of a Lifetime", "When I Look Into Your Eyes" and "Don't Treat Me Bad". Originally composed of vocalist C. J. Snare, guitarist Bill Leverty, drummer Michael Foster, and bassist Perry Richardson, the band has maintained its original members with the exception of Richardson, who departed in 2000. Richardson was replaced three times before current bassist Allen McKenzie was given the position in 2004.</b></p>
